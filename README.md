Description
-----------
With Groupgrade, you can transfer the grading and the feedback of a student in an activity or within a grade item to the other members of his/her group.


Usage
-------
Students have to give group presentations in a seminar. 
The teacher has created the groups in advance in the Moodle course and added an grade item for the group presentation in the “Grades”. 
After the presentations, she enters the points and feedback for one member of each group in the “Grades”. 
The members of a group shall all be graded equally and receive the same feedback. 
The teacher uses the “Groupgrade” option in the “Grades” to easily and simply transfer points and feedback to the other group members. 
All she has to do is select the grade item in the filter options and specify the groups for which the grade transfer should be applied.

Installation
------------
* Copy the code directly into the directory gradereport/gradinggroups. 
* Log into Moodle as administrator.
* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation
  automatically.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------
We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform, database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-gradereport_gradinggroups/issues). Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a screenshot.
You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.
You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the resources to provide detailed support.
