Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform, database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-gradereport_gradinggroups/issues). Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a screenshot.
You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.
You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the resources to provide detailed support.
